# Camo tracker 

This repository is dev-env agnostic. I recommend using Valet running php8.2, with SQLite as the database driver, though MySQL is fine.


## Development processes

Run the local development server:
`npm run dev`

Compile a production build:
`npm run build`

Run tailwind Prettier:
`npm run prettify`


## The project
This project uses [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) to quickly prototype admin panels, used to create and manage weapons and camos.
